# YouTube Video Search App

One of the first tutorials that I watched on React was from Stephen Grider. He had his viewers create a video search app using the YouTube API and Semantic UI for styling.

I found the tutorial very informative, but as my understanding for development began to grow, I decided to challenge myself furhter. How could I make this my own?

I had just began learning how to use React Hooks. My first improvment was refactoring the code with React Hooks. My second improvement was refactoring the Semantic UI to CSS. I added my own styling along the way.

This app allows the user to search for videos. The user will recieve five videos from YouTube's API for each query they enter.
